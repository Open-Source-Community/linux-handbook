# Chapter 2 : Linux History

## Difference between OS and Kernel

### ●  What is the Operating system (OS):
Is system program that provides interface between user and computer .. as it manages all the software(SW) & hardware(HW) on the computer.

### How OS manages apps:
there are several different computer programs running at the same time, need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage .. so OS coordinates all this to make sure every program gets only it's need.

### ● What is Kernel & How it works:

A kernel is the core component of the operating system.

- It's the first program of operating system that is loaded into the main memory to start the working of system .. and remains in memory till the system is shut down.

- Kernal acts as a bridge between application SW & HW of the system .. as it directly communicates with the HW & let it know which SW app has requested.

### ● Kernel Creator:

Kernal has been created by one of the greatest developers ever called: Linus Torvalds 

But linux OS itself was created by a collaboration work by: GNU & Linus.

But the question here, What is GNU?

### ● What's GNU:

GNU is an acronym for: GNU’s Not UNIX. The founder of the GNU project is Richard Stallman.

The GNU project is a replacement for UNIX, was created to produce a free software alternative to Unix, and were able to produce most of the programs of the OS but not the Kernel (it was hard to implement acually).

### ●  Popular Linux Distributions:

- Ubuntu
- Fedora OS
- Linux Mint
- Pop_OS!
- Red Hat Linux
- Arch
- Manjaro

### Diffrences between distros are deppending on what you want to do, For Example: 
 - Usual users (Ubuntu)
 - Developer (Most of Linux Distros: Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian)
 - Artists & music production (Arcolinux)
 - Coporate org. (Red Hat Linux)
 - Lightweight flexible Linux distr (Arch Linux)
 - Cyper Security specialists (Kali Linux)
