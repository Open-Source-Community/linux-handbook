# Open Source

## Philosophy

Open Source is a software development movement that encourages open collaboration, free development, and the belief that the source code of software should be available to anyone. This movement has improved the software industry in an unlimited way.

## Open Source Community ASU

Open source community ASU is a community started in 2013 by a group of students who were passionate about the ideas of open source, Linux, and software development.

Our vision and duty are to emphasize the importance of using open source tools and developing your soft skills as a way to improve your skills for your career path.

### Fun Facts
