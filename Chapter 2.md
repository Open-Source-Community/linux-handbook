## Difference between OS and Kernel

### ●  What is the Operating system (OS):
Is system program that provides interface between user and computer .. as it manages all the software(SW) & hardware(HW) on the computer.

### How OS manages apps:
there are several different computer programs running at the same time, need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage .. so OS coordinates all this to make sure every program gets only it's need.

### ● What is Kernel & How it works:

A kernel is the core component of the operating system.

- It's the first program of operating system that is loaded into the main memory to start the working of system .. and remains in memory till the system is shut down.

- Kernal acts as a bridge between application SW & HW of the system .. as it directly communicates with the HW & let it know which SW app has requested.

### ● Kernel Creator:

Kernal has been created by one of the greatest developers ever called: Linus Torvalds 

In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a young Finnish computer science student, released the first version of the Linux kernel—a core component of the GNU/Linux operating system. Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or MacOS, Linux was open source, meaning anyone could view, modify, and distribute the source code. This open model of development attracted a community of developers who contributed their time and expertise to improve the software.

But linux OS itself was created by a collaboration work by: GNU & Linus.

But the question here, What is GNU?


### ● What's GNU:

GNU is an acronym اختصار for: GNU’s Not UNIX. The founder of the GNU project is software engineer & researcher called: Richard Stallman.

The GNU project was started as a replacement for UNIX operating system , to produce a free software alternative to Unix, and were able to produce most of the programs of the OS but not the Kernel (as it was hard to implement acually).

And one of the key events in the history of open source was the release of the GNU Project in 1983 by Richard Stallman. The GNU Project aimed to create a free Unix-like operating system, and laid the groundwork for the free software movement. Stallman's philosophy of software freedom—freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software—inspired a new generation of developers who believed in the power of open collaboration.

Then after a while, Linus Torvalds came with the Kernel he produced and share it with GNU & Richard Stallman, and it worked very effectively.


### ●  From The Popular Linux Distributions:

- Ubuntu
- Fedora OS
- Linux Mint
- Pop_OS!
- Red Hat Linux
- Arch
- Manjaro


### Diffrences between distros are deppending on what you want to do: 
 - Usual users (Ubuntu - Pop OS! - mint Linux)
 - Developer (Fedora Linux - Manjaro - Ubuntu - other distros )
 - Artists & music production (Arcolinux)
 - Coporate org. (Red Hat Linux)
 - Lightweight flexible Linux distr (Arch Linux)
 - Cyper Security specialists (Kali Linux)
  
  There are also other Linux Distros that are useful for this usages ⬆️, but those are the most popular.
